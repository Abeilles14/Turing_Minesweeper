Select a difficulty level. If you're new to Minesweeper, start with Beginner.
The number in the upper-left corner shows the number of mines on the board.
The number on the right is the timer.
Click any square to begin. Most Minesweeper players click random squares
until a GROUP of squares "opens" up.
If only one square opens after your click, then it would be better
to find another random square to try to open a larger group of tiles.

As you uncover tiles, you will see numbers revealed.
A number means that there are that number of bombs
touching that tile (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
For example, if you see a 1 on the board, it means that square is touching exactly 1 mine.
When you're certain you've found a mine, identify it by right-clicking the square.
This will put a flag on the mine, and prevent you from clicking on it.
If you are unsure, you are free to double click and mark the tile with a question mark.

The game ends when the player has won by opening all cells and flagging all mines,
or has clicked on a mine tile, in which case the player loses.

Left clicking uncovers the contents of a given tile.
Right clicking once marks a tile as a suspected bomb with a flag.
Right clicking twice marks a tile as an unknown tile with a question mark.
